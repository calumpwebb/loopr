## Loopr Integration

This project uses Loopr for autonomous development orchestration. Key files:

- `.loopr/tasks.md` - Current task list (checkboxes with priorities)
- `.loopr/context.md` - Project context and conventions
- `.loopr/completed/` - Archive of completed tasks
- `.loopr/prd/` - Optional: PRD files for importing tasks

### Workflow

```bash
# Initialize loopr (one-time setup)
loopr init

# Analyze and refine tasks (planning phase)
loopr plan

# Implement tasks (build phase)
loopr build

# Import tasks from a PRD/spec file
loopr import docs/feature-spec.md

# Archive completed tasks
loopr archive

# Check current status
loopr status
```

### How It Works

- **Planning**: `loopr plan` analyzes your codebase and refines the task list in `.loopr/tasks.md`
- **Building**: `loopr build` picks the highest-priority unchecked task and implements it
- **Task Format**: Tasks use checkbox format with priorities: `- [ ] Task description (priority: high|medium|low)`
- **Prompts**: Loopr uses embedded prompts (in the binary), not user-editable files
- **Context**: Put project-specific info in `.loopr/context.md` (architecture, conventions, test commands)
